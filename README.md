## 📊 Steps Followed  

### 1️⃣ Data Gathering  
- Connected **SQL Server database** with **Kaggle APIs**.  
- Used **Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)** to fetch and load data into SQL Server.  
- Pulled data into Power BI using **Get Data → SQL Server**.  

**Dataset Used**:(https://www.kaggle.com/)  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Used **Power Query Editor** to remove unnecessary attributes.  
- Kept only important columns relevant for visualization.  

### 3️⃣ Data Modeling  
- Created a **Date Master Table**.  
- Built **one-to-many relationships** between tables.  
- Created measures (e.g., `Total Sales`) and stored them in a **DAX Measures Table**.  

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization  
- Built **4 Dashboard Pages** with navigation:  
  - 🏠 Home  
  - 📦 Orders  
  - 💰 Sales  
  - 👤 Customer View
